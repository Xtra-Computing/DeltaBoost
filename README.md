# DeltaBoost Documentation
DeltaBoost is a machine learning model based on gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) that supports efficient machine unlearning, which is published on [SIGMOD 23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3589313). We provide two methods to reproduce the results in the paper: a master script and a step-by-step guide. The master script will automatically download the datasets, build DeltaBoost, run the experiments, and summary results. The estimated execution time of the master script is a week. The step-by-step guide will show how to run each experiment in the paper.

# Getting Started

## Environment (Docker)
The **recommended** approach for environment configuration is through a docker image. Download the image by
```shell
docker pull jerrylife/deltaboost
```
Create a container named `deltaboost` based on the image.
```shell
docker run -d -t --name deltaboost jerrylife/deltaboost
```
Find the container ID at the first column by
```shell
docker ps
```
Execute the master script in the container in background
```shell
docker exec -t <container-ID> bash run.sh
```
You may also enter the container to observe the results by
```shell
docker exec -it <container-ID> bash
```
**Important:** `download_datasets.sh` is only tested for fresh execution. If a download is terminated and needed to restart, please remove the data folder by `rm -rf data/` before the next execution.

For convenience of manual configuration, we also provide the Dockerfile for image building.

## Environment (Step by Step)

The required packages for DeltaBoost includes 
* g++-10 or above
* OpenSSL
* OpenCL
* CMake 3.15 or above
* GMP
* NTL
* Boost
* Python 3.9+

### Install G++, GCC, OpenSSL, OpenCL, cmake and GMP

```shell
sudo apt install gcc-10 g++-10 libssl-dev opencl-headers cmake libgmp3-dev
```

### Install NTL
The NTL can be installed from source by 
```shell
wget https://libntl.org/ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz
tar -xvf ntl-11.5.1.tar.gz
cd ntl-11.5.1/src
./configure SHARED=on
make -j
sudo make install
```
If `NTL` is not installed under default folder, you need to specify the category of NTL during compilation by
```shell
cmake .. -DNTL_PATH="PATH_TO_NTL"
```

### Install Boost
DeltaBoost requires `boost >= 1.75.0`. Since it may not be available on official `apt` repositories, you may need to install manually.

Download and unzip `boost 1.75.0`.
```shell
wget https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.75.0/source/boost_1_75_0.tar.bz2
tar -xvf boost_1_75_0.tar.bz2
```
Install dependencies for building boost.
```shell
sudo apt-get install build-essential autotools-dev libicu-dev libbz2-dev libboost-all-dev
```
Start building.
```shell
./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr/
./b2
sudo ./b2 install
```

## Reproduce Main Results (Master Script)
We provide a master script to reproduce the main results in the paper. The script will automatically download the datasets, build DeltaBoost, run the experiments, and summary results. The results will be saved in `fig/` and `out/` directory. Simply run
```shell
bash run.sh
```

## Prepare Data

### Install Python Environment
DeltaBoost requires `Python >= 3.9`. The required packages have been included in `python-utils/requirements.txt`. Install necessary modules by
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Download and Preprocess Datasets

Download datasets and remove instances from samples.
```shell
bash download_datasets.sh
```
This script will download 5 datasets from LIBSVM wesbite. After downloading and unzipping, some instances will be removed from these datasets. The removing ratio is `0.1%` and `1%` by default. The time of removal may take several minutes. If more ratios is needed, you can change the `-r` option of `remove_sample.py`. After the preparation, there should exist a `data/` directory with the following structure.

**Important:** `download_datasets.sh` is only tested for fresh execution. If a download is terminated and needed to restart, please remove the data folder by `rm -rf data/` beore the next execution.

## Build DeltaBoost
Build DeltaBoost by
```shell
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```
An executable named `build/bin/FedTree-train` should be created. For convenience, you may create a symlink for this binary.
```shell
cd ..   # under root dir of DeltaBoost
ln -s build/bin/FedTree-train main
```
# Usage of DeltaBoost
For simplicity, the usage guide assumes that the binary `main` has been created.

## Basic Usage
DeltaBoost can be configured by a `.conf` file or/and the command line parameters. For example,
```shell
./main conf=conf/cadata.conf    # By .conf file
./main enable_delta=true nbr_size=10       # By parameters
./main conf=conf/cadata.conf enable_delta=true nbr_size=10  # By both methods
```
When both methods are applied, the parameters in the command line will overwrite the value in the `.conf` file.

Sure, here is a brief parameter guide in markdown format.

## Reproduce Main Results (Step by Step)
Before reproducing the main results, please make sure that the binary `main` has been created. All the time reported are done on two AMD EPYC 7543 32-Core Processor using 96 threads. If your machine does not have the required threads, you may
- reduce the number of seeds, for example, to `5`. However, this increases the variance of the calculated Hellinger distance.
- reduce the require threads, for example, to `taskset -c 0-11`. However, this increases the running time. If you want to use all the threads, simply remove `taskset -c 0-x` before the command.

First, create necessary folders to store results.
```shell
mkdir -p cache out fig
```

### Removing in one tree (Table 4,5)
To test removing in a single tree with Deltaboost, simply run

```shell
bash test_remove_deltaboost_tree_1.sh 100  # try 100 seeds
```
This script finishes in **6 hours**. After the execution, two folders will appear under the project root:

- `out/remove_test/tree1` contains accuracy of each model on five datasets.
- `cache/` contains two kinds of information:
  - original model, deleted model, and retrained model in `json` format.
  - detailed per-instance prediction in `csv` format. This information is used to calculate the Hellinger distance.

To extract the information in a latex table, run

```shell
# in project root
cd python-utils
python plot_results.py -t 1
```
The scripts extracts the **accuracy** and **Hellinger distance** of DeltaBoost into Latex table. The cells of baselines to be manually filled in are left empty in this table.

Two files of summarized outputs are generated in `out/`:
- `out/accuracy_table_tree1.csv`: Results of accuracy in Table 4. An example is shown below.

```csv
,,0.0874\textpm 0.0002,,,0.0873\textpm 0.0005

```

- `out/forget_table_tree1.csv`: Results of Hellinger distance in Table 5. An example is shown below.

```csv
,,0.0002\textpm 0.0051,,,0.1046\textpm 0.2984
,,0.0000\textpm 0.0014,,,0.0070\textpm 0.0515

-,-,0.0028\textpm 0.0036,-,-,0.0093\textpm 0.0079
```

These two results might be slightly different from the results in the paper due to the randomness of the training process. However, the distance between $M_d$ and $M_r$ is very small, which is consistent as the results in the paper.

### Removing in Multiple trees (Table 7)
To test removing in 10 trees with Deltaboost, simply run

```shell
bash test_remove_deltaboost_tree_10.sh 100  # try 100 seeds
```
The script finishes in **2-3 days**. After the execution, two folders will appear under the project root:
- `out/remove_test/tree10` contains accuracy of each model on five datasets.
- `cache/` contains two kinds of information:
  - original model, deleted model, and retrained model in `json` format.
  - detailed per-instance prediction in `csv` format. This information is used to calculate the Hellinger distance.
  
To extract the information in a latex table, run
```shell
# in project root
cd python-utils
python plot_results.py -t 10
```
The script extracts the **accuracy** and **Hellinger distance** of DeltaBoost into Latex table. The cells of baselines to be manually filled in are left empty in this table.

Two files of summarized outputs are generated in `out/`:
- `out/accuracy_table_tree10.csv`: Results of accuracy in Table 7(a). An example is shown below.

```csv

```

These two results might be slightly different from the results in the paper due to the randomness of the training process. However, the distance between $M_d$ and $M_r$ is very small, which is consistent as the results in the paper.

### Efficiency (Table 6)

To test the efficiency, we need to perform a clean retrain of GBDT. To train a 10-tree GBDT, run

```shell
bash test_remove_gbdt_efficiency.sh 10
```

The script retrain GBDT on five datasets with two removal ratios for one time since the GBDT is deterministic. The script finishes in **10 minutes**. After the execution, the efficiency and speedup can be summarized by
```shell
python plot_time.py -t 10
```
The expected output should be like
```text
Thunder	& DB-Train	& DB-Remove	& Speedup (Thunder) \\
 12.410	&  8.053 \textpm 3.976	 &  0.156 \textpm 0.047	 & 79.34x \\
 12.143	&  7.717 \textpm 4.134	 &  0.160 \textpm 0.035	 & 75.82x \\
 15.668	&  52.253 \textpm 4.796	 &  1.482 \textpm 2.260	 & 10.57x \\
 16.015	&  52.333 \textpm 4.107	 &  1.874 \textpm 3.364	 & 8.55x \\
 50.213	&  66.658 \textpm 7.747	 &  0.956 \textpm 0.265	 & 52.51x \\
 47.089	&  65.322 \textpm 7.235	 &  1.123 \textpm 0.259	 & 41.95x \\
 12.434	&  6.038 \textpm 5.198	 &  0.068 \textpm 0.042	 & 183.03x \\
 12.524	&  4.704 \textpm 3.282	 &  0.053 \textpm 0.037	 & 237.99x \\
 22.209	&  53.451 \textpm 3.659	 &  3.523 \textpm 0.812	 & 6.30x \\
 24.067	&  54.221 \textpm 2.952	 &  3.422 \textpm 0.700	 & 7.03x \\
```
The time may vary due to the environment and hardwares, but the speedup is consistently significant as that in the Table 6 of the paper.

We also provide a script to running the baselines: `sklearn` and `xgboost` for efficiency comparison. Note that the performance of `xgboost` vary significantly by version. For example, some versions favors high-dimensional datasets but performs slower on large low-dimensional datasets. We adopt the default version of conda `xgboost==1.5.0` in our experiments. To run the baselines, run
```shell
taskset -c 0-95 python baseline.py  # Also limit the number of threads to 96
```
This script is expected to finish in **10 minutes**. The output contains the accuracy and training time (excluding loading data) of baselines. The expected output should be like

Note that the training time of baselines in this example is longer than that in Table 6 due to the different CPU. Nonetheless, the speedup of DeltaBoost is still similarly significant, thus the conclusion is not affected.

### Memory Usage (Table 8)
The peak memory usage can be easily observed during the training, which is however hard to be recorded by a script. Since the memory consumption is almost consistent during the training, the recommended approach is to manually monitor the peak memory usage of the process in the system monitor, e.g., `htop`.


### Accuracy (Figure 9)
The accuracy of baselines is output by the same command as testing efficiency.
```shell
python baseline.py
```
The accuracy of DeltaBoost has also recorded in the previous logs.

The default max number of trees is `10`, which is sufficient to obtain a promising accuracy. To test the accuracy of baselines with 100 trees, run
```shell
python baseline.py -t 100
```
Since each baseline algorithm is run for only once, this script is expected to finish in **10 minutes**.

Next, we also need to obtain the results of DeltaBoost with 100 trees. To do so, run
```shell
bash test_accuracy.sh 10  # run 10 times
```
This procedure takes around **1-2 days**. For more efficient testing, you can reduce the number of repeats by changing the parameter from `10` to a smaller number. This will result in larger variance in the results.

After obtaining all the results, run
```shell
python plot_results.py -acc -t 10   # (10 trees)
python plot_results.py -acc -t 100  # (100 trees)
```
Two images will be generated in `fig/`, named
```text
acc-tree10.png
acc-tree100.png
```
Both images are similar to Fig. 9 in the paper.


### Ablation Study (Figure 10, 11)
The ablation study includes six bash scripts.
```text
ablation_bagging.sh
ablation_iteration.sh
ablation_nbins.sh
ablation_quantization.sh
ablation_ratio.sh
ablation_regularization.sh
```
These scripts can be run in a single script `test_all_ablation.sh` by
```shell
bash test_all_ablation.sh 50  # run 50 times
```
This combined script takes around **1-2 days**. If you want to run the ablation study in a shorter time, you can reduce the number of repeats by changing the parameter from `50` to a smaller number. This will result in larger variance in the results.

To plot all the figures of ablation study into `fig/ablation`, run
```shell
python plot_ablation.py
```
This plotting process takes around **10 minutes**. The major time cost is calculating Hellinger distance.
